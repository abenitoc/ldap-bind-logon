This patch adds an option to LDAP Authentication to configure the bind user as the user logging in.

Where to use:
In some LDAP databases, due to restricted ACLs, ldap searches are only allowed to the self bind user. 
Due to privacy and security reasons, many universities have this policty bydefault. 
The LDAP directory does not allow anonymous browsing nor exist an account that view the attributes of others.
By this reason, the user that is logging in, needs to be set as the bind user.

Programming Notes:
Instead of using the normal methods like ldap_connect, 
I save my first binded connection in a session variable in order to don't need to continously authenticate in the other methods. 
This way I don't need to keep anything  passwords.
